# Building with Responsive Design and CSS Frameworks

> This is a clone of the [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) webpage built with HTML and designed with CSS3 as well as a CSS Framework known as Bootstrap.

> In this project, the author demonstrates his understanding of Twitter Bootstrap as a CSS Framework which involves the use of predifined CSS styling properties on HTML elements by assigning classes associated with these styling properties to the various HTML elements.

> The project also demonstrates Bootstrap's Responsiveness concept of Mobile first approach by portraying the webpage's different responsive behaviours on various screens ranging from Mobile Screens to Desktop.
